//I cannot figure out how to get the Redux state higher up to main or app because of Router interfering with passing props
// you can connect with withRouter but passing props down through Route components is very messy
//What I read is it is OK to have more than one connected component as long as the children get the props they need and you aren't repeating your code a lot




export default Main;
