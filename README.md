### Let's Play Client

* Client attempt #2, implementing redux as I learn. 
* React router working properly with Switch components.
* Thunk implemented with Fetch for API
* Basic actions/reducers working with direct store.dispatch commands right now for adding and removing friends from list.
* Recreated Search function from scratch - stateful but not redux yet. No filtering but improved search string enough may not need it.
* Components are properly compartmentalized now w/imports

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

### `npm start`

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
